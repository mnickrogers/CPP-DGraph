# CPP-DGraph
Another template directional graph aimed at searching for paths between vertices.

DGraph provides a templte class to construct graphs of arbitrary types. It uses a modified breadth-first-search to find a path between items in the graph. For example, this graph can be used to solve the "word ladder" game where a user forms chains of words by changing only one letter from the previous word.
